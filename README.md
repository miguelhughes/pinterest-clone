## Pinterest Clone

This is a clone of a view from pinterest on an interesting user with cool aviation images. Built with React, HTML and CSS. Its mostly a CSS excercise on tranlating UI designs into a CSS and React responsive layout, with proper shadows, rounded borders and positioning<br>

It features:

- Copyied layout of aviationhd user (limited to 1140 px width), from a [few years back](https://web.archive.org/web/20160617141157/https://www.pinterest.com/aviationhd/)
- CSS responsive layout (cards flow below if screen decreases, and stats in menu change format under 570px)
- relative positioning of pin count hovering over the image.
- The effects of hover and click on the sidebar are also CSS only.
